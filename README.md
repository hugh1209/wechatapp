# WeChat Mini-programs Wiki

### PREFACE
China’s top messaging app WeChat rolled out something quite radical: mini-programs. Embedded apps which require no download, no install. Open, use, share, done!

### What are WeChat mini-programs?
WeChat mini-programs are “sub-applications” within the WeChat ecosystem.
They enable to provide advanced features to users such as e-commerce, task management, coupons etc.

Here are a few examples of WeChat mini programs.
+ JD.com (the second largest B2C e-commerce platform in China) has developed an e-commerce mini-program
+ The shared-bike company Mobike has a mini-program enabling users to locate bikes, unlock them and top-up their account
+ Tesla has a mini-program enabling users to locate charging stations, schedule a test-drive and share their experiences about driving a Tesla car


### Yes, it's not perfect...
There is large debate – *and many clickbaits* – about how practical these apps are... Indeed the framework provided to developers is only at infancy stage, still limited, and honestly a bit frustrating. Nevertheless Tencent is investing unprecedented resources into the adoption of this channel, building momentum, and opening opportunities to the first-movers. We believe that these hackers may find quick-wins if they dare to give it a try.

### WeChat IDE

#### What's this?
An [IDE](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/debug/wxadoc/introduction/index.html?t=201758) (integrated development environment)  is a set of programming tools for writing an application. It consists of a code editor, a compiler and a debugger, accessible through a single graphical user interface.

#### Quick tutorial

Here is a quick tutorial to master the WeChat IDE and take the most from it.

A **Code editor** with the tree of your files on the side and a **Simulator** on the left, which displays the preview of your app.
