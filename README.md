# WeChat Mini-programs Wiki

### PREFACE
China’s top messaging app WeChat rolled out something quite radical: mini-programs. Embedded apps which require no download, no install. Open, use, share, done!

#### Yes, it's not perfect...
There is large debate – *and many clickbaits* – about how practical these apps are... Indeed the framework provided to developers is only at infancy stage, still limited, and honestly a bit frustrating. Nevertheless Tencent is investing unprecedented resources into the adoption of this channel, building momentum, and opening opportunities to the first-movers. We believe that these hackers may find quick-wins if they dare to give it a try.

Got ideas of services you would like to deploy in WeChat asap? Have basic knowledge of Javascript and want to experiment with this framework? Got lost in the Google translation of the doc? Need a small boost to decrypt what is possible or not? Hello and welcome.
